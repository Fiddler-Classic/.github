## What is Fiddler?

**Fiddler** is a powerful and widely-used **web debugging proxy tool** that captures, inspects, and modifies HTTP/HTTPS traffic between your computer and the internet. It allows developers and security experts to monitor network activity, debug web applications, test APIs, and analyze performance issues.

With Fiddler, you can:
- Capture all HTTP/HTTPS traffic in real-time.
- Decrypt and inspect SSL/TLS-encrypted sessions.
- Simulate different network conditions.
- Modify requests and responses on the fly.

Fiddler is essential for **web developers**, **QA engineers**, and **security researchers**. It supports a wide range of features including breakpoints, automatic responses, and custom scripting. Its ability to intercept both web and mobile app traffic makes it a versatile tool for comprehensive debugging and testing.
